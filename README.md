# Uber-Supply-Demand-Case-Study
<h1>Problem Statement</h1>: Find out the supply demand gap & any recommendations to improve the demand-supply gap & Secondly find the types of requests (city-airport or airport-city) for which the gap is the most severe in the identified time slots. 

<h1>Goals of Analysis</h1>:
-> Identify critical problems in availability/ cancellation resulting in declined customer experience <br>
-> Demand-Supply Gap analysis- Understand reasons for demand supply gap .<br>
-> Recommendations- Possible solutions to mitigate the gap .<br>

<h1>Possible data inconsistencies:</h1>
1)Duplicate values of Request ID
2)NA values in the columns of interest

<h1>Other Issues:</h1>
1)Request time stamp is object here. Convert it to date time format.<br>
2)Dates are separated by “/” and “-”. Make this consistent for ease of data analysis.<br>


<h1>Conclusion:</h1><br>
1)Gap is higher than supply for<br>
->Early morning and morning for city pickup<br>
->Evening for airport pickup<br>
2)High morning traffic due to office and schools results in high median of travel time to the airport.<br>
3)Low airport pickup demand results in high wait time at the airport.<br>
4)Lesser cabs reaching airport by evening results in low supply at increased demand time slot.<br>

<h1>Recommendations</h1>
<h2>1)For the trips in the morning, drivers can be incentivised to make those trips.</h2>
1)They could be given a bonus for each trip they complete from the city to the airport in the morning  rush. This will ensure that less number of trips are cancelled.<br>
2)Uber can pay for the gas mileage of drivers to come back to the city without a ride.<br>
3)Drivers staying near the airport would have higher incentive to take the trips. More such drivers can be hired.<br>

<h2>For the evening, since the number of drivers is less, some of the ways are:</h2>
1)Drivers can again be given a bonus to complete a trip from the airport in the evening. This will ensure  that the supply increases at the airport.<br>
2)Uber can also pay drivers to come without a passenger to the airport.<br>
3)Another innovative way can be to pool the rides of passengers so that lesser number of cars can  serve more passengers.<br>
